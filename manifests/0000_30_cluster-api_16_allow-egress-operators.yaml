# This NetworkPolicy allows egress traffic required for the capi-controllers
# deployment.
# The operator needs broad internet access for cluster management operations,
# cloud provider API calls, and communication with various services.
#
# This policy allows all egress traffic from the capi-controllers pod, which is
# necessary because the operator needs to communicate with:
# - Kubernetes API server for cluster management operations
# - Cloud provider APIs for infrastructure management
# - External services for health checks and monitoring
# - Webhook services for validation
# - Container registries and other external services
#
# This approach is more practical than overly granular rules since the operator
# needs broad access to function properly in various environments.
