          CRDCompatibilityRequirement expresses a set of requirements on a target CRD.
          It is used to ensure compatibility between different actors using the same
          CRD.

          Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.
