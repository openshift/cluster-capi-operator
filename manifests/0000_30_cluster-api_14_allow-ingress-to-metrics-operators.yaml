# This NetworkPolicy allows ingress traffic to CAPI operator pods on the metrics port (8443).
# This enables monitoring and observability of the CAPI operator by allowing:
# - Prometheus scraping of operator metrics
# - Health check endpoints for operator status
# - Monitoring tools to collect performance data
# - Observability platforms to track operator behavior
#
# The policy applies to all CAPI controller pods (control-plane label) and allows
# traffic from any namespace or pod to access the metrics endpoint.
# This is essential for maintaining operational visibility of the cluster-api operator.
#
# This policy works with the deny-all policy to ensure metrics are accessible
# while maintaining the default-deny security model for other traffic.
# Note: This policy targets the same controllers as the metrics-controllers policy
# but serves as a separate policy for operator-specific metrics collection.
